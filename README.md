This [repository](https://github.com/IMS-AS-LUH/t41-tri-sync-ptp) provides the source code for our (yet unpublished) research paper. This Arduino compatible library has been created to provide a Tri-Level Sync signal generation based on a PTP-Synchronized clock for the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller platform.

This library was created by the Architectures and Systems Group of the Institute of Microelectronic Systems ([IMS/AS](https://www.ims.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/architekturen-und-systeme/)) at the [Leibniz University](https://www.uni-hannover.de) in Germany.

Further details will be provided later.
